# NextAi

NextAi is an open source solution to a range of AI/ML solutions.

The ultimate goal is to create seamless integrations with Nextjs and allow people to start next generation AI and ML apps faster.

Getting started is simple.

## Getting Started

This will be a simple example app using the [OpenAi API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) and you'll need to create an API Key

### Add API Route

Create a `[nextai].ts` file inside `pages/api/ai` folder, this will create a range of endpoints for you to use.

Inside this file you'll need to paste the following code

```
import NextAi from 'nextai';

export default NextAi({
    Providers: {
        OpenAi: {
            apiKey: process.env.OPENAI
        }
    }
})
```

This creates a range of API endpoints for you to use, however, they will only be activated if the Provider credentials have been set up correctly.

### Frontend Hooks

The frontend libraries are built around reusable hooks which provides state such loading, error, errorMessage and success.
This allows users to be able to build functional apps with less code.
Each Provider will have atleast 1 hook dedicated to it, which will provide a substantial amount of what you need to get started.

The example below is for Open Ai.

```
import React from 'react'
import {useOpenAi} from 'nextai'

export default function Home() {
  const ai = useOpenAi("text-davinci-002");
  const [text, setText] = React.useState<string>("")
  const [res, setRes] = React.useState('')

  const submitHandler = async (e: any) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    const data = await ai.submit(text)
    setRes(data)
  }
  
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Create Next App</title>
        <meta name="description" content="Generated by create next app" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
        <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
      </Head>
      <main>
        <p>{ai.loading && "Loading"}</p>
        <p>{res}</p>
        <p>{ai.errorMessage}</p>
        <form onSubmit={submitHandler}>
          <input onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
          <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </form>
      </main>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Authentication


Authentication is simple with NextAi, all you have to do is pass the type of Auth provider, and if a user is not returned by the provider, they will not be able to access your service.

```
import NextAi from 'nextai';

export default NextAi({
    Providers: {
        OpenAi: {
            apiKey: process.env.OPENAI
        }
    },
    Auth: 'NextAuth'
})
```
